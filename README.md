## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

**The Web3 talent crisis is real.** While Bitcoin's ecosystem is exploding with innovation, builders struggle to find meaningful work and fair compensation. Traditional bounty platforms are fragmented, lack transparency, and don't leverage Bitcoin's programmable layer.

### **The Current Reality:**
- **Builders**: Developers, designers, creators struggle to find quality projects and fair compensation
- **Project Owners**: Can't efficiently distribute work or attract top talent across all disciplines
- **Bitcoin Ecosystem**: Missing a native platform to coordinate and incentivize all types of building
- **Contributors**: Work for free while projects need sustainable funding for development, design, content, and community work

**Result:** Talented builders leave for other ecosystems with better incentive structures.

## ✅ **Validation — Real User Need**

- **1,200%** Bitcoin DeFi TVL growth creating demand for all types of talent
- **200+** Stacks projects needing development, design, content, and community talent

### **Validated User Segments:**
- **DAO Builders** → Transparent, programmable reward distribution
- **Developers & Designers** → Fair compensation for technical and creative work
- **Content Creators** → Native tools for monetizing Bitcoin ecosystem contributions
- **Project Founders** → Efficient crowdsourcing across all building disciplines

### **Perfect Bitcoin/Stacks Fit:**
