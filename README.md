## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

**The Web3 talent crisis is real.** While Bitcoin's ecosystem is exploding with innovation, builders struggle to find meaningful work and fair compensation. Traditional bounty platforms are fragmented, lack transparency, and don't leverage Bitcoin's programmable layer.

### **The Current Reality:**
- **Builders**: Developers, designers, creators struggle to find quality projects and fair compensation
- **Project Owners**: Can't efficiently distribute work or attract top talent across all disciplines
- **Bitcoin Ecosystem**: Missing a native platform to coordinate and incentivize all types of building
- **Contributors**: Work for free while projects need sustainable funding for development, design, content, and community work

**Result:** Talented builders leave for other ecosystems with better incentive structures.
